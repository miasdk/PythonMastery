I need to enhance and debug my progress tracking system. Here's the current situation:

CURRENT ISSUE:
When I solve problems, I'm not seeing XP points being awarded or progress updates in the UI. The backend progress_tracker.py has the logic, but it's not working properly or not being displayed to users.

CURRENT PROGRESS TRACKING ANALYSIS:
My progress_tracker.py includes:
- XP System: 50 base points + efficiency bonus (max 45 bonus for first attempt)
- Streak tracking for consecutive days of problem solving  
- Achievement system (Week Warrior, Problem Solver, Python Master, etc.)
- Problem completion tracking (attempts, best time, hints used)
- Progress percentage calculation

ENHANCEMENT REQUESTS:

1. **Fix XP Award Display:**
   - When user submits correct solution, show XP gained prominently
   - Display: "ðŸŽ‰ Problem Solved! +85 XP earned" (with actual amount)
   - Update user's total XP in real-time on the UI
   - Show XP breakdown: "50 base + 35 efficiency bonus = 85 XP"

2. **Enhanced Progress Feedback:**
   - Show immediate feedback when problem is completed
   - Display updated stats: total problems solved, current streak, total XP
   - Animate XP counter increase for satisfying user experience
   - Show progress bar advancement

3. **Real-Time Achievement Notifications:**
   - Pop-up notifications when achievements are earned
   - Display achievement badge with title and description
   - Show achievement progress (e.g., "8/10 problems toward Problem Solver badge")

4. **Improved Progress Dashboard:**
   - Show detailed XP breakdown and earning history
   - Display all earned achievements with timestamps
   - Show current streak with visual streak counter
   - Progress charts showing learning velocity over time

5. **Concept-Level Progress Tracking:**
   - Track mastery percentage per Python concept (Variables, Loops, Functions, etc.)
   - Show which concepts need more practice
   - Display concept completion progress in lessons

6. **Debug Current Issues:**
   - Verify that update_user_progress() is being called correctly
   - Ensure XP calculations are working and being saved to database
   - Check that frontend is receiving and displaying progress updates
   - Test achievement detection and awarding system

SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION NEEDS:

Frontend Enhancements:
- Toast notifications for XP gains and achievements
- Real-time stats updates in header/sidebar
- Progress animations and visual feedback
- Achievement modal/popup displays

Backend Fixes:
- Ensure progress updates are properly committed to database
- Add logging to track XP award process
- Verify achievement detection logic is working
- Return detailed progress data in API responses

API Response Enhancement:
- Include XP gained in submit-solution response
- Return updated user stats (total XP, streak, achievements)
- Include any new achievements earned
- Provide progress percentage updates

Please implement these enhancements and fix any issues preventing XP from being awarded and displayed properly. Focus on making progress tracking highly visible and motivating for users.
