Please expand my Python learning platform to include 60+ high-quality problems for immediate launch:

CONTENT EXPANSION GOALS:
- Expand curriculum.py to include 8-10 problems per lesson across all sections
- Create clear difficulty progression within each lesson (easy → medium → hard)
- Add diverse problem types for engaging learning experience
- Ensure professional quality worthy of $29/month subscription

PROBLEM DISTRIBUTION TARGET:
Section 1 "Python Basics" (3 lessons):
- Variables & Data Types: 10 problems
- Basic Operations: 8 problems  
- String Manipulation: 10 problems

Section 2 "Control Flow" (3 lessons):
- Conditional Statements: 8 problems
- Loops & Iteration: 10 problems
- Advanced Control Flow: 8 problems

Section 3 "Functions & Modules" (2 lessons):
- Function Basics: 8 problems
- Parameters & Arguments: 8 problems

Section 4 "Data Structures" (2 lessons):
- Lists: 10 problems
- Dictionaries: 8 problems

PROBLEM TYPES TO INCLUDE:
1. Concept Application (40%) - Apply new skills to solve problems
2. Code Completion (25%) - Fill in missing code sections
3. Problem Solving (20%) - Algorithmic and logical challenges
4. Bug Fixing (10%) - Debug broken code snippets
5. Mini-Projects (5%) - Build small functional programs

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
Each problem must have:
- Clear, engaging title and description with real-world context
- Appropriate difficulty level (easy/medium/hard)
- Comprehensive starter code when needed
- Complete working solution
- 3-5 test cases including edge cases
- 3-4 progressive hints that guide without giving away the solution
- Appropriate XP rewards (25-75 points based on difficulty)
- Realistic scenarios (not just abstract exercises)

DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION:
- Easy (40%): Basic syntax, single concepts, clear examples
- Medium (45%): Combining concepts, moderate logic, multiple steps
- Hard (15%): Complex logic, optimization, edge cases, real-world complexity

EXAMPLES OF ENGAGING PROBLEMS:
- "Temperature Converter" instead of "Basic Math"
- "Password Strength Checker" instead of "String Operations"
- "Shopping Cart Calculator" instead of "List Manipulation"
- "Grade Book Manager" instead of "Dictionary Practice"

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
1. Update curriculum.py with all 88 problems following this structure
2. Ensure initialize_curriculum() function populates ALL problems in database
3. Run database population to make all content immediately available
4. Verify all sections/lessons/problems are properly linked and accessible

Make this a comprehensive Python learning experience that justifies premium pricing and demonstrates clear learning progression from beginner to intermediate level.
