The current curriculum has only 29 problems, which is insufficient for a premium product. I need to expand to exactly 60 problems to justify $29/month pricing and create a compelling learning experience.

CURRENT STATUS:
âœ“ Python Basics: 22 problems (COMPLETE - no changes needed)
âœ“ Control Flow: 3 problems (NEED 17 MORE)
âœ“ Functions & Modules: 2 problems (NEED 8 MORE) 
âœ“ Data Structures: 2 problems (NEED 8 MORE)

REQUIRED EXPANSION TO REACH 60 PROBLEMS:

SECTION 2: Control Flow (ADD 17 MORE PROBLEMS)
Current: 3 problems â†’ Target: 20 problems

- Conditional Statements: Currently has some â†’ ADD 4 MORE (total 7)
- Loops & Iteration: Currently has some â†’ ADD 8 MORE (total 8) 
- Advanced Control Flow: Currently minimal â†’ ADD 5 MORE (total 5)

SECTION 3: Functions & Modules (ADD 8 MORE PROBLEMS)
Current: 2 problems â†’ Target: 10 problems

- Function Basics: ADD 3 MORE (total 5)
- Parameters & Arguments: ADD 5 MORE (total 5)

SECTION 4: Data Structures (ADD 8 MORE PROBLEMS)
Current: 2 problems â†’ Target: 10 problems

- Lists: ADD 3 MORE (total 5)
- Dictionaries: ADD 5 MORE (total 5)

PROBLEM QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
Each new problem must include:

**[Problem Title]**
**[Difficulty] - [Main Python Concept]**

**What You're Building:**
[1-2 sentences with real-world context like: e-commerce systems, weather apps, banking calculators, game scoring, social media tools]

**Your Task:**
- [Specific requirement with data type specified]
- [Clear return value requirement]
- [Edge cases to handle]

**Skills Practiced:** [Concept 1] â€¢ [Concept 2] â€¢ [Concept 3]

**Example:**
```python
[Complete working code example with realistic output]
REAL-WORLD CONTEXTS TO USE:

Banking/finance calculators
E-commerce inventory systems
Social media engagement tools
Gaming scoreboards and stats
Weather/climate applications
Student grade management
Task/productivity apps
Restaurant ordering systems

DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION:

Easy (40%): Single concept, clear examples
Medium (50%): Multiple concepts, moderate logic
Hard (10%): Complex logic, optimization, edge cases

XP REWARDS:

Easy: 25-35 XP
Medium: 40-60 XP
Hard: 65-75 XP

IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS:

Create exactly 33 NEW problems (17 + 8 + 8 = 33 additional)
Populate ALL new problems in database immediately
Verify total count reaches exactly 60 problems
Test that all problems are accessible through UI
Ensure smooth difficulty progression within each lesson

This expansion will create a premium-quality curriculum with 60 comprehensive problems worthy of $29/month subscription pricing and provide substantial learning value for users.
Please implement these 33 additional problems now to reach our 60-problem MVP target.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Expansion is Critical:**

### **Current State: Not MVP Ready**
- **29 problems = $1.00 per problem per month** (poor value)
- **Insufficient content** for 2-3 month learning journey
- **Weak competitive position** vs free resources
- **Poor user retention** - users finish too quickly

### **After Expansion: Premium Product**
- **60 problems = $0.48 per problem per month** (excellent value)
- **Substantial content** justifies premium pricing
- **Strong competitive advantage** over free alternatives
- **High user retention** with 2-3 months of content

**This expansion is non-negotiable for launch success. Without 60+ problems, you can't charge premium prices or compete effectively.**
