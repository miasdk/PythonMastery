I need to fix several critical UX issues with progress tracking and problem descriptions:

ISSUE 1: LEARNING PATH NEEDS PROBLEM COUNTS
Current: Shows "Progress 0/3 lessons" 
Required: Show exact problem counts per section and lesson

Example format needed:
- Python Basics (22/22 problems) ‚úÖ
  - Variables & Data Types (8/8 problems) ‚úÖ  
  - Basic Operations (6/6 problems) ‚úÖ
- Control Flow (5/20 problems) üîÑ
  - Conditional Statements (7/7 problems) ‚úÖ
  - Loops & Iteration (3/8 problems) üîÑ
  - Advanced Control Flow (0/5 problems) ‚è≥

ISSUE 2: PROGRESS NOT SAVING/UPDATING
- Dashboard shows incorrect current position
- Progress doesn't persist between sessions
- Current problem detection not working properly
- Fix progress tracking to accurately reflect user's actual position

ISSUE 3: INCOMPLETE PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS
Current: "# Example usage will be shown here"
Required: Either:
A) Remove this placeholder text entirely, OR
B) Populate with actual meaningful examples

If keeping examples, make them realistic:
```python
# Instead of placeholder, show:
name, price, stock, on_sale = create_product_details()
print(f"Product: {name} - ${price}")
# Output: "Product: Gaming Laptop - $1299.99"
PRIORITY FIXES:

Update sidebar to show problem counts: "Section Name (completed/total problems)"
Fix progress tracking so dashboard reflects actual user position
Either remove "# example usage will be shown here" or populate with real examples
Ensure user's current position saves and displays correctly

Test these fixes by:

Completing several problems and verifying progress updates
Refreshing page to ensure progress persists
Checking that sidebar accurately shows completion status
Confirming dashboard "Continue Learning" points to correct next problem
