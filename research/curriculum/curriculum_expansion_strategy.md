  context: string;         // Real-world scenario (2-3 sentences)
  description: string;     // Clear requirements and expectations
  starterCode: string;     // Professional comments, proper structure
  testCases: TestCase[];   // 3-5 comprehensive tests
  hints: string[];         // Progressive guidance system
  xpReward: number;        // 50-150 based on complexity
  businessTags: string[]; // Industry relevance markers
}
```
