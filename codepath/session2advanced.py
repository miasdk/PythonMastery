Problem 1: Transpose Matrix

Write a function transpose() that accepts a 2D integer array matrix and returns the transpose of matrix. The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, swapping the rows and columns.

Example Usage:

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
transpose(matrix)  # Output: [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]
transpose(matrix)  # Output: [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]

"""
Problem 2: Two-Pointer Reverse List

Write a function reverse_list() that takes in a list lst and returns elements of the list in reverse order. The list should be reversed in-place without using list slicing (e.g. lst[::-1]).

Instead, use the two-pointer approach, which is a common technique in which we initialize two variables (also called a pointer in this context) to track different indices or places in a list or string, then moves the pointers to point at new indices based on certain conditions. In the most common variation of the two-pointer approach, we initialize one variable to point at the beginning of a list and a second variable/pointer to point at the end of list. We then shift the pointers to move inwards through the list towards each other, until our problem is solved or the pointers reach the opposite ends of the list.

Example Usage:

lst = ["pooh", "christopher robin", "piglet", "roo", "eeyore"]
reverse_list(lst)  # Output: ["eeyore", "roo", "piglet", "christopher robin", "pooh"]

Problem 3: Remove Duplicates

Write a function remove_dupes() that accepts a sorted array items, and removes the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once. Return the length of the modified array. You may not create another array; your implementation must modify the original input array items.

Example Usage:

items = ["extract of malt", "haycorns", "honey", "thistle", "thistle"]
remove_dupes(items)  # Output: 4

items = ["extract of malt", "haycorns", "honey", "thistle"]
remove_dupes(items)  # Output: 4

Problem 4: Sort Array by Parity

Given an integer array nums, write a function sort_by_parity() that moves all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.

Return any array that satisfies this condition.

Example Usage:

nums = [3, 1, 2, 4]
sort_by_parity(nums)  # Output: [2, 4, 3, 1]

nums = [0]

Problem 5: Container with Most Honey

Christopher Robin is helping Pooh construct the biggest hunny jar possible. Help his write a function that accepts an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most honey.

Return the maximum amount of honey a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example Usage:

height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
most_honey(height)  # Output: 49

most_honey(height)  # Output: 1

Problem 6: Merge Intervals

Write a function merge_intervals() that accepts an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
merge_intervals(intervals)  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

Problem 1: Matrix Addition

Write a function add_matrices() that accepts to n x m matrices matrix1 and matrix2. The function should return an n x m matrix sum_matrix that is the sum of the given matrices such that each value in sum_matrix is the sum of values of corresponding elements in matrix1 and matrix2.

Problem 2: Two-Pointer Palindrome

Write a function is_palindrome() that takes in a string s as a parameter and returns True if the string is a palindrome and False otherwise. You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabetic characters.

The function must use the two-pointer approach, which is a common technique in which we initialize two variables (also called a pointer in this context) to track different indices or places in a list or string, then moves the pointers to point at new indices based on certain conditions. In the most common variation of the two-pointer approach, we initialize one variable to point at the beginning of a list and a second variable/pointer to point at the end of list.

Problem 3: Squash Spaces

Example Usage:

Problem 4: Two-Pointer Two Sum

Use the two pointer approach to implement a function two_sum() that takes in a sorted list of integers nums and an integer target as parameters and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to target.

Problem 6: Insert Interval

Implement a function insert_interval() that accepts an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. The function also accepts an interval new_interval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert new_interval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return intervals after the insertion.

You don't need to modify intervals in-place. You can make a new array and return it.
