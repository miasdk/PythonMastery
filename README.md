## Key Technical Features

### Adaptive Learning Algorithm
The core AI engine analyzes multiple learning signals to personalize difficulty:
```python
# Adaptive Difficulty Calculation
def calculate_next_difficulty(user_performance):
    factors = {
        'success_rate': user_performance.recent_success_rate,
        'average_time': user_performance.average_completion_time,
        'hint_usage': user_performance.hints_per_problem,
        'error_patterns': analyze_common_errors(user_performance),
        'learning_velocity': calculate_learning_speed(user_performance)
    }
    return optimize_difficulty_for_user(factors)
```

### Secure Code Execution
Production-ready Python sandbox with comprehensive security:
- **Timeout Protection** - Prevents infinite loops and resource exhaustion
- **Import Restrictions** - Controlled module access for security
- **Resource Limits** - Memory and CPU usage constraints
- **Output Capture** - Complete execution result logging
- **Error Analysis** - Intelligent error categorization and suggestions

### Advanced Progress Analytics
```sql
-- Learning Velocity Tracking
SELECT 
    user_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('week', completed_at) as week,
    COUNT(*) as problems_completed,
    AVG(best_time) as avg_completion_time,
    AVG(attempts) as avg_attempts,
    SUM(xp_reward) as weekly_xp
FROM user_progress 
WHERE is_completed = true
GROUP BY user_id, week
ORDER BY week DESC;
```

### Real-Time Performance Monitoring
- **Learning Pattern Recognition** - Identifies optimal learning times and methods
- **Skill Gap Analysis** - Pinpoints areas needing additional practice
- **Engagement Metrics** - Tracks session duration, return frequency, and learning consistency
- **Predictive Analytics** - Forecasts learning outcomes and suggests interventions
